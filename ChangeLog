   * Graphics/GLUT_windows/glut_windows.c: munted the create_GLUT_window
      function to always return a RGB double buffered window in an attempt
      to get around display problems on Nvidia + Ubuntu Lucid issues
      With thanks to Hugh Fisher

	* configure.in: added error output if missing GLUT/GL
	* epm-header.in: removed netcdf, changed from Register to register

2005-02-28  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Fix save_image.c to calculate the correct parameters to pass to
	the ImageMagick "import" utility.
	* Changed color mapping to mimic the behavior of Display.  This
	change allows Register to load images in the original type (with
	only normal slice normalization), which in turn should cause us to 
	represent the full range of the data rather than mapping volumes
	onto a single-byte range. The crucial issue here was that for
	non-RGB images, the previous code created the merged images by 
	calculating a 2D array of composited colors, indexed by the voxel
	values of volume 1 and volume 2 to get the composite color for
	each merged pixel.  This was practical only because the volume was
	mapped onto the 0-255 byte range. As soon as the range widened to,
	say, 0-65535, the scheme falls apart because we cannot allocate a
	65536x65536x4 array of colormap entries to perform this lookup 
	operation.
	Thankfully, a solution already existed in the form of the code to
	implement the merged images when using RGB volumes.  Since there
	is no lookup table for RGB volumes, the code special-cased them to
	form the merged image by first calculating the individual pixel
	maps for volume 1 and volume 2, then calculating the
	composite. This is slower but clearly much less memory intensive.
	* Fixed a small bug that caused incorrect 0.0 voxel values to 
	display for 4D volumes.

        * Changes to autoconf build that allows a native build on OSX
        also changes to various headers so that gl.h and glut.h are found

2005-01-25  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Added file User_interface/windows/xsect.c, which implements the
	"timecourse" (cross-section) window.
	* Changed color maps and voxels to be 16-bit rather than
	8-bits. This allows greater voxel precision.  This should be
	generalized further to allow arbitrary precision of voxel values.
	* Implemented support for time-varying (functional) files.
	* Added the 'T', '>', and '<' keyboard commands
	
2004-09-01  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * Use ImageMagick's 'import' utility rather than 'scrsave' to
	implement the image capture functionality.  This allows us to
	save ".tiff" format files on those platforms where ImageMagick
	is available.
	
2004-06-29  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Stubbed out copy_x_colours.c in the Graphics/GLUT_windows 
	directory.  This function appears to be unnecessary in 99% of
	cases, and it relied upon undocumented GLUT features which are
	not duplicated in FreeGLUT.
	
2004-06-28  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Remove old m4 directory contents
	* Update autogen.sh to require checkout of m4 from 
	libraries/mni-acmacros 
	* Update configure.in to use mni_REQUIRE_BICPL
	
2003-12-16  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Set version to 1.3.4.  Use -lXi and -lm when
	probing for libglut; add all X libs to GL_LIBS variable.

	* Makefile.am (register_LDADD): Don't link with X libs as they are
	now in $(GL_LIBS).
	(man_MANS): Install register manpage.

2003-05-29  Steve ROBBINS  <stever@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* User_interface/main/main.c: Use autoconf-generated version
	string for "-version".
	(HARD_CODED_REGISTER_DIRECTORY1): Add $(prefix) to top of
	search list for file "register_UI.globals".

	* Makefile.am (blurg_DATA): Install file "register_UI.globals"
	into $(libdir).

2001-08-11  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 1.3.3.

	Add CVS tag Register-1_3_2.

2001-07-24  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* autogen.sh: Improved ordering; stop on error; use "aclocal -I m4".

	* acinclude.m4: Remove.

	* m4/smr_OPTIONAL_LIB.m4:
	* m4/smr_REQUIRED_LIB.m4:
	* m4/smr_WITH_BUILD_PATH.m4: New files.  These replace the old
	smr_CHECK_LIB macro in acinclude.m4.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Distribute new m4 files and
	register_UI.globals.

	* INSTALL.register: Describe usage of register_UI.globals.

	* configure.in: Use new macros.  Check for glut, GLU, and GL
	libraries.

2001-07-09  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* acinclude.m4 (AC_HELP_STRING): Disable the too-clever pretty
	formatter.

2001-05-22  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* branch-1_3 merge: Many files added for autoconfig.

	* acinclude.m4: New.  Concatenation of the two m4 files
	distributed from "smr_macros-0.2.4"
	[from www.cs.mcgill.ca/~stever/software].

	* User_interface/main/main.c:
	* User_interface/Include/user_interface.h:
	* Tagtoxfm/tagtoxfm.c:
	* Functionality/initialize/initialize.c:
	* Functionality/Include/register.h: Change include from "foo.h" to
	"bicpl/foo.h", to match current practice of the "bicpl" library
	(formerly known as BIC_PL).

	* configure.in: New.  Added infrastructure for autoconf-generated
	build procedure.  The subdirectories Functionality, Graphics, 
	UI_calls_F, and User_interface do not yet have automake-generated
	makefiles; they include "Makefile.include", however, which now
	*is* generated, so some of the variable definitions are generated
	there automatically.

	* common_include.h: Change include from "internal_volue_io.h" to
	"volume_io/internal_volume_io.h", to match recent MINC practice.

2001-05-22  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* User_interface/event_callbacks/tag_events.c:	Rolled back
	to version 1.7.

	* Functionality/initialize/main.c:
	* Functionality/tags/matrix_basics.c:
	* Functionality/tags/matrix_procrustes.c: Removed.

	* tagged as david-source-2001-05-22.  This set of sources is
	identical to the current contents of ~david/Source/Register (with
	this ChangeLog added).

2000-10-07  Steve Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

	* tagged as release-1_3: sources copied from
	~david/Source/Register, with two files rolled back one revision,
	to match the `Display+register_src_v1.3' tarball, distributed from
	David's web page.

	* User_interface/event_callbacks/tag_events.c:	
	* User_interface/event_handling/window_events.c: rolled back to 
	version found in Display+register_src_v1.3, distributed from
	web page.
