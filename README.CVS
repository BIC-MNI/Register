After checking out from CVS, you need to perform the following steps
from the top-level source directory (i.e. the one containing this file):

1. cvs -d /software/source/libraries checkout bicgl -d Graphics
   (yes, two "-d" options --- type the line verbatim)

2. ./autogen.sh

You will need reasonably recent versions of autoconf and automake.
These steps need only be done once.
