# register

Interactive volume display and point tagging program

`register [OPTION]... [FILE]...`

## DESCRIPTION

*Register* is an interactive graphics application that can display two
 or more volumes (typically MR or PET). The rightmost section of the
 display shows the merged image of the volumes. There are three viewports for each volume, showing transverse, sagittal, and coronal slices. The user can move throughout the volumes, and create tag points within the volumes. If two volumes are loaded and enough tag points are created, then a transformation is computed for registering the two volumes. This transform is used to display the merged image and to allow the user to start a process which resamples one of the volumes into the same space as the other.

## FILES

Up to eight MINC, NIfTI-1, or MGZ (FreeSurfer) volume files can be specified
on the command line. These files will be displayed from left to right in
the order they are specified on the command line.

In addition, you can specify a tag point file (extension .tag) to
pre-load a set of tag positions.

A custom colour map file (extension .ccd) can also be specified. The
custom colour map will apply to the volume that follows the custom
colourmap on the command line.

A byte vector volume will normally be treated as an RGB volume, in that
the first three byte values will be interpreted as red, blue, and green
intensities. Alternatively, the vector can be converted to a scalar
whose value is the mean of the vector components, by setting the global
variable *Convert_vectors_to_rgb* to FALSE.

## OPTIONS

The following command line options are recognized:

`-global NAME VALUE`
Sets the global variable *NAME* to *VALUE*.

`-sync`  
Start the program with the two volume positions synchronized.

`-range VOLUME MIN MAX`
Force the initial colour mapping range of *VOLUME* (either 0 or 1) to the values *MIN* and *MAX*.

`-gray`
Subsequent listed volumes should use the gray scale colourmap.

`-spectral`
Subsequently listed volumes should use the spectral colourmap.

`-hot`
Subsequently listed volumes should use the hot metal colourmap.

`-red`
Subsequently listed volumes should use the red colourmap.

`-blue`
Subsequently listed volumes should use the red colourmap.

`-green`
Subsequently listed volumes should use the red colourmap.

`-version`  
Print the program version number and exit.

## USER INTERFACE

The user interface is a mouse-based interface composed of buttons,
sliders, and text entry. Buttons can be pressed with the left mouse
button. Text entries can be changed by pressing the left mouse button on
them, then typing text. Typing return signals the text entry is
done. Typing escape ends text editing without modifying the text. The
delete, cursor left, and cursor right keys may be used. Ctrl-a and
Ctrl-e move the cursor to the beginning and end of text,
respectively. Ctrl-u deletes all text in the text entry.

The up and down arrow keys navigate between the tag point fields.

The left and right arrow keys increase or decrease the displayed slice coordinate for the volume under the mouse pointer.

The '>' and '<' keys will step forward and backward in the time dimension of the volume under the mouse pointer, if possible.

The 'S' key will save the slice image under the mouse in a file named "register_image_NNN.ppm".

The 'T' key will display a window containing the graph of the timecourse of the currently selected voxel, if the current volume has a time dimension.

The 'R' and 'E' keys will move the blend slider to the right or left,
respectively. This allows for changing the relative visibility of the
first two merged volumes from the keyboard. However, it is active only with the
'Blend' merge method.

## MAIN MENU

*Quit:* Quits the program, after confirmation.

*Resample:* Resamples the second volume to place it in the same space as the first, according to the transformation defined by the tag points.

*Resample Filename:* Text entry to set the name of the file to create for the resampling.

*Not Synced / Synced:* Toggle whether the cursor position in world coordinates is shared between all volumes.

*Load Tags:* Loads a set of tag points into the program.

*Tags Filename:* Text entry to set name of filename to be used by load and save tags. A default extension ".tag" is provided automatically.

*Save Tags:* Saves all active tag points to a file. If one volume is loaded, then a set of single tags is saved. If two volumes are loaded, then a set of pairs of tags are saved.

*Save Transform:* Saves the transform defined by the tag points, if
 enough tag points have been defined to fully specify the transform.

*Transform Filename:* Text entry to set name of filename to be used by save transform. A default extension ".xfm" is provided automatically.

*Record Tag:* Overwrites the current tag point positions with the current positions within the volumes. If the current tag point is the end of the tags, then it creates a new tag point.

*Delete Tag:* Deletes the current tag point.

*Delete All Tags:* Pops up a confirmation box allowing you to delete all the tags.

*Transform Type:* Pops up a dialog to select 6 parameter, 7 parameter,
 9 parameter, 12 parameter affine, or thin-plate spline non-linear fitting.

*Tags Visible/Invisible* Toggles the display of tag point positions on the slices.

*Cursor Visible/Invisible:* Toggles the display of cursor crosshair on the slices.

*Interp: Flat/Smooth:* Toggles the display of slices between flat and smooth shading. Smooth shading takes longer to update but produces higher quality images, especially noticeable when the images are zoomed up.

*RMS:* Displays the average RMS error of the tag points, if a transform exists.

## VOLUME MENUS

*Voxel and World Position Readouts* Displays the position of the volume
 cursor in voxel and world coordinates. The positions can be changed
 directly by clicking on the field and typing in the desired position.
The time position will be displayed for time-varying volumes.

*Load Volume:* Loads the volume specified in the volume filename field.

*Volume Filename:* Specifies the volume filename.

*Reset View:* Resets the scale and translation of the slices to fit in the viewports.

*Filter* Pops up a dialog window that selects the filter type for each
of the 3 views of the volume. The filtering applies across slices, but
not within a slice. The filter types are: nearest neighbour, linear
interpolation, box filter, triangle filter, and Gaussian filter. The
full-width half-maximum of the filter can also be set.

*Volume Value Readout:* Displays the value of the voxel at the cursor
 position.

*Opacity Slider* Sets the weight of the volume in the merged panel, if
 the volume is in Blended mode.

*Blended/Opaque/Off* Clicking this button selects one of three modes for
combining this volume with the other volumes in the merged view. Blended
mode uses the opacity value selected to weight the image. Opaque mode
draws the volume over all of the blended volumes. Off mode omits this
volume from the merged view.

*Under Colour:* Sets the colour displayed for voxels whose values are
 less than the lower limit of the colour map.

*Over Colour:* Sets the colour displayed for voxels whose values are
 greater than the upper limit of the colour map.

*Colour Bar Slider:* Sets the range of the colour map. The left mouse
button can be used to drag the upper or lower limit. The middle mouse
button is used to move both at the same time. You can enter a specific
value for the lower or upper limit by entering them in the edit field.

*Colour Coding Buttons:* Sets the colour coding method to one of gray
 scale, hot metal, spectral, red, green, or blue.

## MERGED MENU

*Voxel and World Position Readouts:* Displays the position of the volume
 cursor in voxel and world coordinates. The positions can be changed
 directly by clicking on the field and typing in the desired position.

*Volume Value Readouts:* Displays the value of the voxel at the cursor
 position, for each of the loaded volumes.

*Reset View:* Resets the scale and translation of the slices to fit in the viewports.

*Blend Slider* Sets the relative weights of the first two volumes. Only
 useful if both volumes are in Blended mode.

## TAGS MENU

*Position:* Displays tag positions. Positions can be directly edited.

*Name:* Sets the name of a tag.

*On / Ignore:* Controls whether the tag contributes to the transformation.

*Dst:* Displays the distance of the tag point in the first volume from the position of the transformed

## TIMECOURSE MENU

*Full range/Scaled:* Toggle the Y-axis range between the either the full range of the volume or scaled to the specific time course.

*T(min):* Set the minimum time displayed (typically in seconds).

*T(max)* Set the maximum time displayed.

*Save* Save the current graph's data points to an ASCII file.

*Save filename* Sets the filename which the *Save* button will use.

*Close* Closes the timecourse window.

## MOUSE AND KEYBOARD

In the slice viewports, the following actions are valid:

*Left Mouse:* Sets the volume cursor position.

*Middle Mouse:* Moves slice perpendicular according to the Y position of mouse.

*Right Mouse:* Adds a new tag point at the current volume cursor positions.

*Shift/Ctrl/Alt Left Mouse:* Translates the slice display

*Shift/Ctrl/Alt Middle Mouse:* Zooms the slice display according to the
 y position of the mouse.

*Scroll up/Scroll down*: Zooms the slice display.
