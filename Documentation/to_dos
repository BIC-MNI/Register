    add -global support
    make it choose right display mode
    make it choose right window size
    loading tags overwrites - add a confirm popup
    default tag name should be volume1 filename
    loading a resampled volume doesn't regenerate tag display list.
    moving through slices depends on sign of separations.
    click on first doesn't update view
    tag files volume name on output should be the original tag volume
    load already resampled volume
    cannot change voxel position at extreme end of slices
    8 bit machines
    filtering for merged view

~neelin/src/register_code/tagtoxfm/compute_xfm.h

    union of merged images rather than intersection
    cut and paste


LATER

    no clearing if volume not resized or moved
    popup a slice window
    colour map in slider

MAYBE

    smaller chunks on input file
    pick current tag point on slice

ROIDIS

    check  ~tomas/meta*.cnt

BUGS

    when reloading volume1 with a different sample, the merged image
    view gets screwed up.
