.SH NAME
MNI-register - interactive volume display and point tagging program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B register
[OPTION]... [volume1_file] [volume2_file] [tag_file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Register
is an interactive graphics application that can display two
volumes (typically MR or PET), and the merged image of the two. There
are three viewports for each volume, showing transverse, sagittal, and
coronal slices.  The user can move throughout the volumes, and create
tag points within the volumes. If two volumes are loaded and enough tag points 
are created, then a transformation is computed for registering the two
volumes. This transform is used to display the merged image and to allow
the user to start a process which resamples one of the volumes into the
same space as the other.

A byte vector volume will normally be treated as an RGB volume, in that
the first three byte values will be interpreted as red, blue, and green
intensities. Alternatively, the vector can be converted to a scalar
whose value is the mean of the vector components, by setting the global
variable
.I Convert_vectors_to_rgb
to FALSE.

.SH OPTIONS
The following command line options are recognized:
.TP
.BR \-global " " \fINAME\fR " " \fIVALUE\fR
Sets the global variable \fINAME\fR to \fIVALUE\fR.
.TP
.BR \-sync
Start the program with the two volume positions synchronized.
.TP
.BR \-range " " \fIVOLUME\fR " " \fIMIN\fR " " \fIMAX\fR
Force the initial colour mapping range of \fIVOLUME\fR (either 0 or 1)
to the values \fIMIN\fR and \fIMAX\fR.
.TP
.BR \-version
Print the program version number and exit.

.SH USER INTERFACE
The user interface is a mouse-based interface composed of buttons, sliders,
and text entry. Buttons can be pressed with the left mouse button. Text
entries can be changed by pressing the left mouse button on them, then typing
text. Typing return signals the text entry is done. Typing escape ends
text editing without modifying the text. The delete, cursor left, and
cursor right keys may be used.  Ctrl-a and ctrl-e move the cursor to the
beginning and end of text, respectively. Ctrl-u deletes all text in the text
entry.

The up and down arrow keys navigate between the tag point fields.

The left and right arrow keys increase or decrease the displayed slice 
coordinate for the volume under the mouse pointer.

The '>' and '<' keys will step forward and backward in the time
dimension of the volume under the mouse pointer, if possible.

The 'S' key will save the slice image under the mouse in a file named
"register_image_NNN.tiff".

The 'T' key will display a window containing the graph of the timecourse
of the currently selected voxel, if the current volume has a time
dimension.

.SH MAIN MENU
.P
.I Quit:
Quits the program, after confirmation.
.P
.I Resample:
Resamples the second volume to place it in the same space as the first,
according to the transformation defined by the tag points.
.P
.I Resample Filename:
Text entry to set the name of the file to create for the resampling.
.P
.I Not Synced / Synced:
Toggle whether the cursor position in world coordinates is shared
between all volumes.
.P
.I Colour Map / RGB:
Toggles between colour map mode (faster updates) and RGB mode (truer colours).
.P
.I Double / Single:
Toggles between double and single buffer mode.
.P
.I Load Tags:
Loads a set of tag points into the program.
.P
.I Tags Filename:
Text entry to set name of filename to be used by load and save tags.  A
default extension ".tag" is provided automatically.
.P
.I Save Tags:
Saves all active tag points to a file.  If one volume is loaded, then
a set of single tags is saved.  If two volumes are loaded, then a set
of pairs of tags are saved.
.P
.I Save Transform:
Saves the transform defined by the tag points, if it exists.
.P
.I Transform Filename:
Text entry to set name of filename to be used by save transform.  A
default extension ".xfm" is provided automatically.
.P
.I Record Tag:
Overwrites the current tag point positions with the current positions within
the volumes.  If the current tag point is the end of the tags, then it creates
a new tag point.
.P
.I Delete Tag:
Deletes the current tag point.
.P
.I Delete All Tags:
Pops up a confirmation box allowing you to delete all the tags.
.P
.I Transform Type:
Pops up a dialog to select 6 parameter, 7 parameter, 12 parameter, or
thin-plate spline non-linear fitting.
.P
.I Tags Visible/Invisible
Toggles the display of tag point positions on the slices.
.P
.I Cursor Visible/Invisible:
Toggles the display of cursor crosshair on the slices.
.P
.I Interp: Flat/Smooth:
Toggles the display of slices between flat and smooth shading.  Smooth shading
takes much longer to update (a few seconds), but produces higher quality images,
especially noticeable when the images are zoomed up.
.P
.I RMS:
Displays the average RMS error of the tag points, if a transform exists.

.SH VOLUME MENUS
.P
.I Voxel and World Position Readouts
Displays the position of the volume cursor in voxel and world coordinates.
The positions can be changed directly by clicking on the field and
typing in the desired position.
.P
.I Load Volume:
Loads the volume specified in the volume filename field.
.P
.I Volume Filename:
Specifies the volume filename.
.P
.I Reset View:
Resets the scale and translation of the slices to fit in the viewports.
.P
.I Filter
Pops up a dialog window that selects the filter type for each of the
3 views of the volume. The filtering applies across slices, but not within
a slice. The filter types are: nearest neighbour, linear interpolation,
box filter, triangle filter, and gaussian filter.
.P
.I Under Colour:
Sets the colour displayed for voxels whose values are less than the range.
.P
.I Over Colour:
Sets the colour displayed for voxels whose values are greater than the range.
.P
.I Colour Bar Slider:
Sets the colour range. The left mouse can be used to drag the upper or lower
limit. The middle mouse is used to move both at the same time.
.P
.I Colour Coding Buttons:
Sets the colour coding method to one of gray scale, hot metal, spectral,
red, green, or blue.

.SH MERGED MENU
.P
.I Voxel and World Position Readouts:
Displays the position of the volume cursor in voxel and world coordinates.
The positions can be changed directly by clicking on the field and
typing in the desired position.
.P
.I Reset View:
Resets the scale and translation of the slices to fit in the viewports.
.P
.I Merge Method Buttons:
Sets the merge method to one of blend, weighted, one on two, or two on one.
Blend allows blending between the two volumes. Weighted allows arbitrary
weights for the two volumes. One on two places volume one on top of volume
two, with volume two showing through if volume one is out of range. Two
on one is the opposite.
.P
.I Opacity Sliders
Sets the weights of the two volumes. Only used if the merge method is
blend or weighted.

.SH TAGS MENU
.P
.I Position:
Displays tag positions. Positions can be directly edited.
.P
.I Name:
Sets the name of a tag.
.P
.I On / Ignore:
Controls whether the tag contributes to the transformation.
.P
.I Dst:
Displays the distance of the tag point in the first volume from the
position of the transformed

Toggle the Y-axis range between the either the full range of the volume
or scaled to the specific time course.

.I T(min):
Set the minimum time displayed (typically in seconds).

.I T(max)
Set the maximum time displayed.

.I Save
Save the current graph's data points to an ASCII file.

.SH BUGS
Sometimes turning the tags visibilities off does not turn them off.
.P
Switching between colour map and rgb mode or double/single buffer on the
OpenGL version sometimes prints error messages, or core dumps.

In smooth interpolation mode, filtering has not been implemented.
