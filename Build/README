-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that this package relies on having the following packages in the current
directory

NetCDF library:  ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/minc/netcdf-2.3.2.tar.Z
MINC library:    ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/minc/minc.tar.Z

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MNI-Display is an interactive program to display and segment 3 dimensional
images, as well as to display and manipulate 3D geometric objects.

MNI-register is an interactive program to display and merge 2 volumes and
pick homologous points for manually registering one volume to the other.

These sources build MNI-Display and MNI-register, as well as 4 supporting
libraries.  The code compiles and runs on SGI, SUN, DEC, and Linux workstations,
but has only been tested extensively on SGI.  Use at own risk.

Step 1:  To set the path, and determine architecture, type

             cd Makefile_multi_architecture ; make ; cd ..

         and follow the instructions it gives to 'source' the following file:

             source Makefile_multi_architecture/cshrc.csh


Step 2:  To build everything, type

             make

         and follow the instructions it gives to 'source' the following file:

             source cshrc.csh

         then type one of:

             make irisgl
             make opengl
             make mesa

Note:  if you get a message that the variables FC or OS must be defined, then
       type (if in using csh)
             setenv FC /bin/true  
             setenv OS linux               (or whatever operating system)
