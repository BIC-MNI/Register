Jens P. had some problems re-building on MacOSX.
Needed to link with -lXext.  Maybe should copy
Display's use of libtool, since the Display build from
last summer worked on the new machine (with MacOSX's
OpenGL) while Register needed Mesa installed and
a recompile.


* fix register manpage with respect to 
  - vector volumes
  - global settings
